                                You must be fully insured for your holiday and must make sure that all of the activities which you will be carrying out are covered under such insurance, protecting against unforeseen circumstances that could otherwise spoil your travels. Cover must include medical expenses and repatriation in the event of accident or illness. In addition, we strongly recommend that you have cover for personal belongings, delay at your outward or homeward point of departure, personal liability, company insolvency, overseas legal expenses and cancellation. If you are undertaking any sports or adventurous activities, including trekking, on your trip you should also make sure that your policy covers these. Please also ensure you read the policy conditions and exclusions.

                                        your contract with us once you have paid your deposit (or other fee
                                        such as in a last minute booking). In the following terms and

                                        a) To book a holiday you must first call us to discuss your itinerary
                                        or request a quotation. If you are satisfied with the quotation you
                                        should complete, sign and return the booking form to us together
                                        with the non-refundable deposit (see below). The lead client who
                                        makes the booking is taken to have accepted these terms and
                                        conditions on behalf of and with the authorization of all the
                                        persons named on the booking. Written quotations are valid for a
                                        period of 20 days from the date of our quotation, unless otherwise
                                        indicated.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        b) A service fee is chargeable for all bookings and ticketing
                                        provided by River of Footsteps Travel staf. This is at the discretion of the
                                        Company, and mutually agreed upon by both parties before
                                        confirming the booking.
                                    </p>

                                        c) The deposit, 30% of your total holiday, is non-refundable and
                                        will be treated as part payment of the holiday. The deposit amount
                                        will be shown on the quotation page of your itinerary and should
                                        be paid by the lead client. In addition to the deposit, full or part
                                        payment may sometimes be required before the balance due date
                                        (such as for flights).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        d) Once we receive the deposit we will issue a written confirmation
                                        of the booking, at which point a binding contract is formed
                                        between us. Once we are able to confirm all elements of your
                                        holiday booking, a process that may take several weeks, we will
                                        send you a confirmation invoice including details of the balance
                                        payment.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        e) Unless a last minute booking, the balance payment is due no
                                        later than 10 weeks prior to departure, or at the time of booking if
                                        less than 10 weeks prior to departure. The balance due date will be
                                        included in the confirmation invoice (please note that reminders
                                        are not sent). If the balance payment is not received by the due
                                        date we reserve the right to cancel your booking as per the terms
                                        below.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        f) Clients should pay all bank charges for bank transfers. Failure to
                                        do so may lead to you being rebilled.
                                        </p><p>
                                        g) We will always quote the price of your holiday by reference to
                                        the base currency in which the booking would be made by us, on
                                        the date that the quotation is created. If an adverse currency
                                        fluctuation occurs, equal to 2% or more of the overall price during
                                        the period between the date of the quotation and the date(s) for
                                        payment of the deposit and/or final balance payment for the
                                        holiday, we reserve the right to adjust the final balance payment
                                        due to reflect such currency fluctuation.
                                    </p>

                                        a) If, after we have confirmed a booking, you wish to make
                                        alterations to the dates or other details of your booking we will try
                                        but cannot promise to meet your request. We require the lead
                                        person to notify us of required changes in writing. We reserve the
                                        right to charge you 2% of the total holiday booking for changes. If
                                        we can make the requested changes you will be provided with a
                                        quote detailing any costs incurred by ourselves and any costs
                                        imposed by our suppliers.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        b) Cancellations must be notified to us in writing by the lead client
                                        and will be efective the day we receive them. As we incur costs
                                        from the time of your booking, the following cancellation charges
                                        will be payable. We will not refund to you any deposits,
                                        administrative fees or alterations fees. You must take out holiday
                                        insurance that covers cancellation of your booking. We cannot
                                        guarantee any flight refunds. Cancellation charges apply as a
                                        percentage of the total holiday price, as follows.

                                        In the event that the cancellation charges of the suppliers we use
                                        are more than ours, then the suppliers’ cancellation terms will
                                        apply.
                                    </p>

                                        c) If a member of a party is prevented from traveling the person
                                        concerned may transfer their place to someone else as long as our
                                        suppliers accept the transfer of names, you sign an authorization
                                        letter and the transferee signs a booking form. All costs incurred by
                                        us and any of our suppliers, an amendment fee of Singapore

                                        before any such transfer is efective. If you decide during the
                                        course of your holiday to abandon arrangements made by us no
                                        liability and no refunds will be made for the service you choose not
                                        to take.

                                        a) It is unlikely we will have to make changes to your travel plans
                                        and we do our utmost to deliver the holiday we are contracted to
                                        provide. However, as we make arrangements many months in
                                        advance we occasionally have to make changes and reserve the
                                        right to do so.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        b) Most changes are minor and we will inform you of them if
                                        possible. Occasionally, we have to make a major change. A major
                                        change is a change made before departure which, taking account
                                        of the information you give us at the time of booking and which we
                                        can reasonably expect to know as a tour operator, we can
                                        reasonably expect to have a major efect on your holiday. Major
                                        changes may include: price increases, change of your
                                        city/resort/place of destination, or change of your accommodation
                                        to a lower grade. If we make a major change to your holiday we will
                                        inform you as soon as possible. You will then have the choice of: (i)
                                        accepting the changes, (ii) accepting an ofer of an alternative 
                                        holiday from us of a similar standard to that already booked, or (iii)
                                        cancelling your holiday and receiving a full refund of all monies
                                        due.
                                        </p><p>
                                        c) We will not accept liability if we are forced by ‘force majeure’ to
                                        change or terminate your holiday. ‘Force majeure’ means unusual
                                        and unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control, the
                                        consequences of which neither us nor our suppliers could avoid.
                                        These may include, but are not limited to, war, threat of war, riot,
                                        civil strife, terrorist activity (actual or threatened), industrial
                                        dispute, technical problems with transports, machinery or
                                        equipment, power failure, natural or nuclear disaster, fire, flood,
                                        drought or storm, other adverse weather conditions including
                                        heavy rainfall, hail, snow or frost.
                                    </p>

                                        a) Once the price of your holiday has been confirmed on your
                                        confirmation invoice then subject to the correction of errors, we
                                        will only increase the price and request a surcharge in the
                                        following circumstances: increases in our transportation charges
                                        (including the cost of fuel), dues, taxes, airport charges or the
                                        exchange rates used to calculate the cost of your holiday.
                                        </p><p>
                                        b) Even in the above cases, only if the amount of any increase in
                                        our costs exceeds 2% of the total cost of your holiday will we levy
                                        a surcharge. If the surcharge is greater than 10% you reserve the
                                        right to cancel your holiday within 14 days of our notifying you of
                                        the surcharges, after which we reserve the right to add a surcharge
                                        over the 10% of the total holiday price.
                                        </p><p>
                                        c) Quotations will be provided in Singapore Dollars (SGD).

                                        a) We accept responsibility for ensuring that the holiday
                                        arrangements that you book with us are supplied as described in
                                        the itinerary provided, and in accordance with these terms and
                                        conditions. If you feel that your holiday arrangements are not as
                                        described in your itinerary, you should notify our appointed local
                                        supplier or us (where no local supplier is appointed) as soon as

                                        </p><p>
                                        b) We endeavour to keep the website and any brochures up to date,
                                        but cannot guarantee their accuracy and, if there is any
                                        inconsistency between the information on our website and the
                                        itinerary details provided to you, the itinerary details prevail.

                                        c) We accept responsibility for our suppliers and local

                                        terms of the relevant travel provider shall apply; or (ii) holidays,
                                        activities or other bookings or arrangements made directly with
                                        our suppliers, local representatives or any other third parties.
                                        </p><p>
                                        d) Under no circumstances will we accept responsibility for any
                                        indirect or consequential loss whatsoever arising under or in
                                        connection with our provision of your holiday.

                                        e) Nor do we accept responsibility for any injury, illness, death, loss

                                        (as described in Paragraph 3 above) which are beyond our or our
                                        suppliers’ reasonable control.

                                        f) Our total liability to you in respect of all other losses arising

                                        g) Nothing in these terms and conditions shall limit or exclude our
                                        liability where such exclusion is not permitted under applicable
                                        law.

                                        The terms and conditions which apply to your holiday are those
                                        which are featured on your booking form at the time of booking,
                                        and any other terms notified to you in writing before departure. We
                                        reserve the right to update these terms and conditions from time
                                        to time. Any such updates shall take efect immediately upon

                                        Please read these terms and conditions carefully, as they set out
                                        your contract with us once you have paid your deposit (or other fee
                                        such as in a last minute booking). In the following terms and
                                        conditions ‘you’ and ‘your’ means all persons named on the
                                        booking, including anyone who is added or substituted at a later
                                        date. Please pay particular attention to Paragraph 5 (Our
                                        Responsibility).

                                    <font class="tcBulletHeading">1. Booking and Payment</font><br/>
                                    <p>
                                        a) To book a holiday you must first call us to discuss your itinerary
                                        or request a quotation. If you are satisfied with the quotation you
                                        should complete, sign and return the booking form to us together
                                        with the non-refundable deposit (see below). The lead client who
                                        makes the booking is taken to have accepted these terms and
                                        conditions on behalf of and with the authorization of all the
                                        persons named on the booking. Written quotations are valid for a
                                        period of 20 days from the date of our quotation, unless otherwise
                                        indicated.
                                        </p><p>
                                        b) The deposit, 30% of your total holiday, is non-refundable and
                                        will be treated as part payment of the holiday. The deposit amount
                                        will be shown on the quotation page of your itinerary and should
                                        be paid by the lead client. In addition to the deposit, full or part
                                        payment may sometimes be required before the balance due date
                                        (such as for flights).
                                        </p><p>
                                        c) Once we receive the deposit we will issue a written confirmation
                                        of the booking, at which point a binding contract is formed
                                        between us. Once we are able to confirm all elements of your
                                        holiday booking, a process that may take several weeks, we will
                                        send you a confirmation invoice including details of the balance
                                        payment.
                                        </p><p>
                                        d) Unless a last minute booking, the balance payment is due no
                                        later than 10 weeks prior to departure, or at the time of booking if
                                        less than 10 weeks prior to departure. The balance due date will be
                                        included in the confirmation invoice (please note that reminders
                                        are not sent). If the balance payment is not received by the due
                                        date we reserve the right to cancel your booking as per the terms
                                        below.
                                        </p><p>
                                        e) Clients should pay all bank charges for bank transfers. Failure to
                                        do so may lead to you being rebilled.</p><p>
                                        f) We will always quote the price of your holiday by reference to
                                        the base currency in which the booking would be made by us, on
                                        the date that the quotation is created. If an adverse currency
                                        fluctuation occurs, equal to 2% or more of the overall price during
                                        the period between the date of the quotation and the date(s) for
                                        payment of the deposit and/or final balance payment for the
                                        holiday, we reserve the right to adjust the final balance payment
                                    due to reflect such currency fluctuation.</p>
                                    
                                    <br/>
                                    <font class="tcBulletHeading">2. Alterations and cancellation by you</font><br/>
                                    <p>
                                        a) If, after we have confirmed a booking, you wish to make
                                        alterations to the dates or other details of your booking we will try
                                        but cannot promise to meet your request. We require the lead
                                        person to notify us of required changes in writing. We reserve the
                                        right to charge you 2% of the total holiday booking for changes. If
                                        we can make the requested changes you will be provided with a
                                        quote detailing any costs incurred by ourselves and any costs
                                        imposed by our suppliers.
                                        </p><p>
                                        b) Cancellations must be notified to us in writing by the lead client
                                        and will be efective the day we receive them. As we incur costs
                                        from the time of your booking, the following cancellation charges
                                        will be payable. We will not refund to you any deposits,
                                        administrative fees or alterations fees. You must take out holiday
                                        insurance that covers cancellation of your booking. We cannot
                                        guarantee any flight refunds. Cancellation charges apply as a
                                        percentage of the total holiday price, as follows.
                                        <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
                                            <li>75 days or more Deposit only</li>
                                            <li>74 – 50 days 40%</li>
                                            <li>49 – 29 days 60%</li>
                                            <li>28 – 7 days 90%</li>
                                            <li>6 days or less 100%</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        
                                        In the event that the cancellation charges of the suppliers we use
                                        are more than ours, then the suppliers’ cancellation terms will
                                        apply.</p><p>
                                        c) If a member of a party is prevented from traveling the person
                                        concerned may transfer their place to someone else as long as our
                                        suppliers accept the transfer of names, you sign an authorization
                                        letter and the transferee signs a booking form. All costs incurred by
                                        us and any of our suppliers, an amendment fee of Hong Kong
                                        Dollars (HKD) 750, and any overdue balance payment must be paid
                                        before any such transfer is efective. If you decide during the
                                        course of your holiday to abandon arrangements made by us no
                                        liability and no refunds will be made for the service you choose not
                                    to take.</p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <font class="tcBulletHeading">3. Alterations and cancellation by us</font><br/>
                                    <p>
                                        
                                        a) It is unlikely we will have to make changes to your travel plans
                                        and we do our utmost to deliver the holiday we are contracted to
                                        provide. However, as we make arrangements many months in
                                        advance we occasionally have to make changes and reserve the
                                        right to do so.
                                        </p><p>
                                        b) Most changes are minor and we will inform you of them if
                                        possible. Occasionally, we have to make a major change. A major
                                        change is a change made before departure which, taking account
                                        of the information you give us at the time of booking and which we
                                        can reasonably expect to know as a tour operator, we can
                                        reasonably expect to have a major efect on your holiday. Major
                                        changes may include: price increases, change of your
                                        city/resort/place of destination, or change of your accommodation
                                        to a lower grade. If we make a major change to your holiday we will
                                        inform you as soon as possible. You will then have the choice of: (i)
                                        accepting the changes, (ii) accepting an ofer of an alternative
                                        holiday from us of a similar standard to that already booked, or (iii)
                                        cancelling your holiday and receiving a full refund of all monies
                                        due.
                                        </p><p>
                                        c) We will not accept liability if we are forced by ‘force majeure’ to
                                        change or terminate your holiday. ‘Force majeure’ means unusual
                                        and unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control, the 
                                        consequences of which neither us nor our suppliers could avoid.
                                        These may include, but are not limited to, war, threat of war, riot,

                                        the period between the date of the quotation and the date(s) for payment of the deposit and/or ﬁnal balance payment for the holiday, we reserve the right to adjust the ﬁnal balance payment due to reﬂect such currency ﬂuctuation.

                                        b) Cancellations must be notiﬁed to us in writing by the lead client and will be e ective the day we receive them. As we incur costs from the time of your booking, the following cancellation charges will be payable. We will not refund to you any deposits, administrative fees or alterations fees. You must take out holiday insurance that covers cancellation of your booking. We cannot guarantee any ﬂight refunds. Cancellation charges apply as a percentage of the total holiday price, as follows.
                                        <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
                                            <li>75 days or more Deposit only</li>
                                            <li>74 – 50 days 40%</li>
                                            <li>49 – 29 days 60%</li>
                                            <li>28 – 7 days 90%</li>
                                            <li>6 days or less 100%</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        In the event that the cancellation charges of the suppliers we use are more than ours, then the suppliers’ cancellation terms will apply.
                                        </p><p>
                                        c) If a member of a party is prevented from traveling the person concerned may transfer their place to someone else as long as our suppliers accept the transfer of names, you sign an authorization letter and the transferee signs a booking form. All costs incurred by us and any of our suppliers, an amendment fee of United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED) 300, and any overdue balance payment must be paid before any such transfer is effective. If you decide during the course of your holiday to abandon arrangements made by us no liability and no refunds will be made for the service you choose not to take.

                                    <p>
                                        a) It is unlikely we will have to make changes to your travel plans and we do our utmost to deliver the holiday we are contracted to provide. However, as we make arrangements many months in advance we occasionally have to make changes and reserve the right to do so.
                                        </p><p>
                                        b) Most changes are minor and we will inform you of them if possible. Occasionally, we have to make a major change. A major change is a change made before departure which, taking account of the information you give us at the time of booking and which we can reasonably expect to know as a tour operator, we can reasonably expect to have a major e ect on your holiday. Major changes may include: price increases, change of your city/resort/place of destination, or change of your accommodation to a lower grade. If we make a major change to your holiday we will inform you as soon as possible. You will then have the choice of: (i) 
                                        accepting the changes, (ii) accepting an o er of an alternative holiday from us of a similar standard to that already booked, or (iii) cancelling your holiday and receiving a full refund of all monies due.
                                        </p><p>
                                        c) We will not accept liability if we are forced by ‘force majeure’ to change or terminate your holiday. ‘Force majeure’ means unusual and unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control, the consequences of which neither us nor our suppliers could avoid. These may include, but are not limited to, war, threat of war, riot, civil strife, terrorist activity (actual or threatened), industrial dispute, technical problems with transports, machinery or equipment, power failure, natural or nuclear disaster, ﬁre, ﬂood, drought or storm, other adverse weather conditions including heavy rainfall, hail, snow or frost.

                                        a) Once the price of your holiday has been conﬁrmed on your conﬁrmation invoice then subject to the correction of errors, we will only increase the price and request a surcharge in the following circumstances: increases in our transportation charges (including the cost of fuel), dues, taxes, airport charges or the exchange rates used to calculate the cost of your holiday.
                                        </p><p>
                                        b) Even in the above cases, only if the amount of any increase in our costs exceeds 2% of the total cost of your holiday will we levy a surcharge. If the surcharge is greater than 10% you reserve the right to cancel your holiday within 14 days of our notifying you of the surcharges, after which we reserve the right to add a surcharge over the 10% of the total holiday price.
                                        </p><p>

                                        </p><p>
                                        d) Under no circumstances will we accept responsibility for any indirect or consequential loss whatsoever arising under or in connection with our provision of your holiday.

                                        e) Nor do we accept responsibility for any injury, illness, death, loss (including loss of enjoyment and loss of business, proﬁts or 
                                        employment), damage, expense, cost or other claims or liability of any description whatsoever which results from: (i) any fault of you or any member of your party, (ii) any fault of any third party unconnected with us and the provision of the services for which you have contracted with us; (ii) any force majeure circumstances (as described in Paragraph 3 above) which are beyond our or our suppliers’ reasonable control.
                                        </p><p>
                                        f) Our total liability to you in respect of all other losses arising under or in connection with the Contract, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise shall not exceed the value of your booking (including taxes and deposit).
                                        </p><p>
                                        g) Nothing in these terms and conditions shall limit or exclude our liability where such exclusion is not permitted under applicable law.
